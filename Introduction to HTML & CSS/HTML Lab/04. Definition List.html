            HTML is the standard language used to structure content on the web. It defines the elements and layout of a webpage, like headings, paragraphs, images, and links. Every webpage starts with HTML, as it forms the foundation of the content that browsers display.

            CSS is used to style and visually enhance the HTML structure, defining how elements appear, such as colors, fonts, spacing, and layout. It separates content from design, allowing developers to control the look and feel of multiple pages easily. CSS makes web pages more visually appealing and user-friendly.
